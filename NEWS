                      ** sc68 project - NEWS **


3.0.0a  <ben>

        This is an alpha version. Things might change before the
        official release.

        This is the first version of sc68 new generation. This is
        a fresh version of this NEWS file.

        There has been changes in API without backward compatibility
        but portage should be easy.

        The new BLEP YM-2149 engine is used by default. It has a
        better sound rendering. Old (pulse) engine has been improved
        too and enhanced by a set of user selectable filters.

        Add projects for various back-end specially for gstreamer
        which should allow sc68 files to be played with most modern
        Linux players.

        New tools for creating (mksc68) and debugging (cdbg68) sc68
        files replacing the good old debug68.
