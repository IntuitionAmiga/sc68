                      ** sc68 project - NEWS **


3.0.0a  <ben>

        This is an alpha version. Some things might change before the
        official release.

        This is the first version of sc68 new generation. This is
        where is new NEWS file start.

        Change in the API without backward compatibility but portage
        should be easy.

        The new BLEP YM-2149 engine is used by default. It has a
        better sound rendering. Old engine has been improved too and
        enhanced by user selectable filters.

        Add project for various back-end specially for gstreamer which
        should allow sc68 files to be played with most modern Linux
        players.

        New tools for creating (mksc68) and debugging (cdbg68) sc68
        files replacing the good old debug68.
