	Release 3.0.0

	Major changes in both API and internal codes.

	This library appears in this release. It contains the former
	io68, emu68 and api68 libraries from older sc68 releases. It
	offers a simplier way to play an sc68 file within third party
	applications.

	The library reentrant is now *REENTRANT* aka (thread
	safe). Pratically it means one can play several sc68 file at
	the same time in the same program.

	YM-2149 emulation rendering quality has been largely improved
	by using lowpass and hipass filters.

	It is now possible (let say easier) to use variant of an
	emulator. For instance the YM-2149 could be rendered either
	way by sc68 original emulator or by Antti Lankila's BLEP
	(Bandlimited Step) synthesis emulator.
