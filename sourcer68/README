*Synopsis*

  sourcer68 is a program using desa68 m68k disassembler library to
  source various m68k target. It's designed in the first place to help
  in the ripping process of music code for the sc68 music library. For
  that reason it can be interfaced with the file68 library to
  source/disassemble sc68 compatible files. It also supports binary
  and TOS programs.

  Initially sourcer68 a simple cli program but since version 20150319
  it is intended to be controled by a front end program allowing a
  better user control.


*Files*

  sourcer.c .......... Main program.
  src68_*.c .......... Other sourcer files.
  src68_*.h .......... Corresponding headers.


*Version*

  20090117

    The previous stable version.

  20150319

    Use the new desa68-20150319 library. It's a complete rewrite of
    the sourcer. Replaced the old monolitic source by something
    modular and hopefully easier to maintain. This version is a work
    in progress so it is not fully operationnal yet.
