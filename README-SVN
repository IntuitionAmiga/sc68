                   Introduction to sc68 SVN version
                   --------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
           
  This  file aims  to help  developers to  use sc68  version  from SVN
  repository. Basically  SVN repository only host files  which are not
  generated  by   any  mean.  It  excludes  all   files  generated  by
  GNU/autotools such as Makefile.in. Some files are duplicates used in
  multiple sub-package. Those are for example sc68 autoconf m4 macros.


QUICK-START

  -1- Make a fresh directory structure

      $ mkdir -p sc68-svn/_build && cd sc68-svn

  -2- Get sc68 source tree
 
      $ svn co https://sc68.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sc68 sc68

  -3- Prepare source tree (bootstapping)

      Require:
        - autoconf >= 2.63
        - automake >= 1.10
        - libtool  >= 2.2.6
        - help2man
        - texinfo2man
            This tools is part of indent package but it is not
            installed by most distrib. A copy of the source file
            texinfo2man.c has been added for conveniency to sc68 SVN
            repository in tools/ directory .

      $ cd sc68                 # Enter top source directory.
      $ tools/svn-bootstrap.sh  # Run bootstrap bourne shell script.

      For details on previous step you are invited to snoop at file
      tools/svn-bootstrap.sh.

  -4- Build

      Build in a different directory architecture is not required but
      it is a good habit.

      $ build=$(./config.guess) # Guess native host
      $ mkdir ../_build/$build  # Create host build directory
      $ cd ../_build/$build     # Go there
      $ ../../sc68/configure    # Configure as you feel
      $ make                    # Build

      See INSTALL file for more information on configure.
