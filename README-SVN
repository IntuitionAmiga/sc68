                   Introduction to sc68 SVN version
                   --------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
           
  This file aims to help developers to use sc68 version from SVN
  repository. Basically SVN repository only host files which are not
  generated by any mean. It excludes all files generated by
  GNU/autotools such as Makefile.in. Some files are duplicates used in
  multiple sub-package. Those are for example sc68 autoconf m4 macros.


QUICK-START

  -1- Make a fresh directory structure

      $ mkdir -p sc68-svn/_build && cd sc68-svn

  -1- Get sc68 source tree
 
      $ svn co https://sc68.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sc68 sc68

  -2- Prepare source tree (preconfigure)

      Require:
        autoconf >= 2.63
        automake >= 1.10
        libtool  >= 2.2.6

      $ cd sc68/<package>       # enter package (e.g as68)
      $ ln -s ../aclocal68 m4   # link (or copy) m4 macros
      $ autoreconf -iv          # run GNU/autotools

      This step has to be repeated in each sub-package you want to
      compile. For a sc68 engine the following sub package are
      required: unice68, file68 and libsc68.

  -3- Build

      Build in a different directory architecture is not required but
      it is a good habit.

      $ cd sc68-svn/_build      # Go into the _build dir from step -1-
      $ mkdir <package>         # 
      $ cd <package>            #
      $ ../../sc68/<package>/configure --enable-maintainer-mode ...
      $ make

      The configure step with --enable-maintainer-mode and the
      following make is required at least one time to create some
      missing files. After that you can re-run configure without the
      --enable-maintainer-mode

      See INSTALL file for more information on configure.
