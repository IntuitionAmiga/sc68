INTRODUCTION

  This document aims  to help developers to use  sc68 version from SVN
  repository. Basically  SVN repository only host files  which are not
  generated  by  any  mean.    It  excludes  all  files  generated  by
  GNU/autotools such as Makefile.in. Some files are duplicates used in
  multiple sub-package. Those are for example sc68 autoconf m4 macros.


QUICK-START

  -1- Make a fresh directory structure
				   
      $ mkdir -p sc68-svn/_build && cd sc68-svn

  -2- Get sc68 source tree

      $ svn co https://sc68.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sc68 sc68

  -3- Prepare source tree (bootstapping)

      Require:
        - autoconf >= 2.63
        - automake >= 1.11
        - libtool  >= 2.2.6
        - help2man
        - texinfo2man
            This  tools  is part  of  indent  package  but it  is  not
            installed  by most  distrib.  A copy  of  the source  file
            texinfo2man.c has  been added for conveniency  to sc68 SVN
            repository in  tools/ directory. You can  for instance run
            'make'  there and install  'texinfo2man' anywhere  in your
            exec PATH.

        - as68
            as68 is a 68000 macro assembler compatible with HISOFT(tm)
            GenST(tm).  It  is  used  to  assemble  libsc68  TOS  trap
            emulator.  It is  part of  sc68. You  can use  any working
            version of as68,  like one from an older  sc68 package. If
            you  don't have  a running  version  of as68  you need  to
            compile and install it before you can build libsc68.

      $ cd sc68                 # Enter top source directory.
      $ tools/svn-bootstrap.sh  # Run bootstrap bourne shell script.

      For details  on previous step you  are invited to  snoop at file
      tools/svn-bootstrap.sh. It  should basically prepare  the source
      tree and checks you have all required tools installed.

  -4- Build as68 (required only if as68 is missing)

      Build in a different  directory architecture is not required but
      it is a good habit. This set of commands is just an example, you
      might want to add some configure options.

      $  build=$(./config.guess)        && # Guess native host
      $  mkdir -p ../_build/$build/as68 && # Create host build dir
      $  cd ../_build/$build/as68       && # Go there
      $  ../../../sc68/as68/configure   && # Configure as you feel
      $  make                           && # Build
      $  make install                      # Install as68 (sudo)

  -5- Build sc68

      Build in a different  directory architecture is not required but
      it is a good habit. This set of commands is just an example, you
      might want to add some configure options.

      $  build=$(./config.guess)   && # Guess native host
      $  mkdir -p ../_build/$build && # Create host build directory
      $  cd ../_build/$build       && # Go there
      $  ../../sc68/configure      && # Configure as you feel.
      $  make                         # Build

      One way to build a release build is to execute configure with
      options --enable-release --disable-assert.

      See INSTALL file for more information on configure.  Also
      concidere using `configure --help=recursive | less' in the top
      most to see all available options.

HACKING

  Having a  look to the  current code should  give you a good  idea of
  sc68 code  conventions. Basically strict rules are  not required but
  it is a  nice thing to try to  stick with it. If you  have to follow
  only a fews rules you  should consider using:

   - space as tab
   - indent width of 2
   - line width of 78

  Emacs  users  may  use  the  sc68.el file  located  in  the  topmost
  directory. This piece of emacs lisp code adds a *sc68* C-code-style.
  One way (not the smartest) to use this style is to do this in emacs:

  M-x load-file (select sc68.el file)
  M-x c-set-style (select sc68 style)
