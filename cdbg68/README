*Synopsis*                                   

  cgdb68 is a 68000 debugger with a curses UI specially design for
  debugging sc68 files. It was meant to replace the debug function of
  the older debug68 program.

  However it's unfinished and discontinued since sc68 support GDB
  remote protocol debugging.
