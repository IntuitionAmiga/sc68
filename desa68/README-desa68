  desa68 is  a 68000 disassembler library with  enhanced features that
  help to trace branch instructions.

  Optionnally the disassembler may  disassemble with symbol instead of
  absolute  address  or long  immediate.   A  supplemental control  is
  available to choose  the range of address that  must be disassembled
  as symbol.

  A  good sample  is may  be found  in the  sourcer68  directory. This
  library is also used by the cdbg68 (discontinued) program.
