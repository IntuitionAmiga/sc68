*Synopsis*

  desa68 is a simple 68000 disassembler library designed to help to
  source 68000 code. Some features like branch following, typed-data
  tracking, registers involved or instruction types helps in that
  regard.


*Files*

  desa68.h .......... desa68 sole API header.
  desa68.c .......... The disassembler source file.


*Version*

  20090117

    The previous stable version.

  20150319

    A slightly different API. Some fields in the main structure have
    changed but the general idea did not really changed. User
    callbacks for memory access, output string generation, symbol
    lookup and their private user data companion field (cookie).
    Memory references (wrongly named effective address in the previous
    version) are now better tracked, including the type of reference
    (branch, address, memory access).


*Using*

  A good sample may be found in the sourcer68 directory. This library
  is also used by the cdbg68 (discontinued) program.
