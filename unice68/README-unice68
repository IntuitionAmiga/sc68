unice68  project is  a  "C" library  and  a command  line program  for
depacking !ICE2.40 compressed files.

ICE was  a common  compressor running on  Atari ST(tm)  and compatible
machines. sc68 project needs to  handle the many ICE! compressed Atari
ST music files (including Grazer' SNDh collection).

In the  begin unice68  was a front-end  to the original  *native* ICE!
depacker routine written in  68000 assembler. It was functional enough
but pretty much slow so I decided to convert the 68000 assembly to "C"
code. This conversion is straight forward and kinda ugly.

The library can  not be used for true  streaming decompression meaning
it  has to  load an  entire file  in order  to process  it. This  is a
consequence of the way data is  stored by ICE!.  First data is located
at  the  end of  the  file and  the  decompression  process read  data
backward (from  end to beginning).  Fortunately most  ICE!  files used
nowadays are pretty much small  for today's system and can be entirely
loaded into memory.
